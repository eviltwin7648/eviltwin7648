# Hi, I'm Vishal 👋  
Backend Engineer • Distributed Systems • Node/TypeScript

I build backend systems with a focus on clean architecture, reliability, and scalability.  
Recently worked on real-world event-driven workflows: queues, DLX routing, retries, schedulers, payments, pipelines, and CRM workflows.

---

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- **Open-source Job Runner** — distributed workers, DLX, retries, backoff, heartbeats, logs  
- **Case studies** on real backend problems (queues, APIs, webhooks, scaling patterns)  
- Improving skills in **WebSockets**, **streaming systems**, and **infra fundamentals**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Bash, GO (learning)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express,   
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis  
- **Messaging:** RabbitMQ (DLX, TTL, retries, schedulers), Streams (learning)  
- **Infra:** Docker, Nginx, AWS basics  
- **Other:** REST APIs, authentication, payment flows, multi-tenant systems
